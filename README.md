# haggadah

Copyright 2015 (c) William (Zev) Prahl

A (XeLaTeX) traditional passover haggadah with some original English translations.

To print the haggadah, first make sure that you have the following Hebrew fonts intsalled:

 - Mekorot Vilna (http://mekorot.sourceforge.net)
 - Mekorot Rashi
 - Shlomo Stam (https://sites.google.com/site/orlaeinayim/download)
 - Shlomo Semi-stam

Then, typeset the prahl_haggadah.tex file. This will create a pdf formatted on half-letter sized paper, and therefore easy to peruse on a digital device. To create a printout, then typeset the booklet.tex file, which will output a letter paper-formatted pdf that can be printed double sided (long-edge binding), folded and stapled to form a serviceable haggadah for use at the seder.

WARNING: Although I've eliminated most of them, the haggadah is still shemos (bearing the divine name). Please exercise extreme care not to make unecesary copies, and if they need to be disposed of please leave them with to be buried in a genizah.

I created this repository based on the haggadah I created for my 2015/5775 seder. Updates are likely to be irregular, until next Pesah.
