# haggadah

Copyright 2015 (c) William (Zev) Prahl

A (XeLaTeX) traditional passover haggadah with some original English translations. Comes in two varieties: one formatted for booklet printing on a home printer (for use at the seder) and one optimized for web/digital reading (for personal edification).

I created this repository based on the haggadah I created for my 2015/5775 seder. Updates are likely to be irregular, until next Pesah.
