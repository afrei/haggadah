# haggadah

Copyright 2015 (c) William (Zev) Prahl

A (XeLaTeX) traditional passover haggadah with some original English translations. Comes in two varieties: one formatted for booklet printing on a home printer (for use at the seder) and one optimized for web/digital reading (for personal edification).

WARNING: Although I've eliminated most of them, the haggadah is still shemos (bearing the divine name). Please exercise extreme care not to make unecesary copies, and if they need to be disposed of please leave them with to be buried in a genizah.

I created this repository based on the haggadah I created for my 2015/5775 seder. Updates are likely to be irregular, until next Pesah.
